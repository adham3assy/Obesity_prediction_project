## ðŸ“– Overview:

Obesity is a major global health challenge with growing prevalence and serious economic implications. Traditional interventions often lack personalization. This project addresses the challenge by developing a machine learning pipeline to predict **NObeyesdad** (obesity levels) based on user input, offering potential for targeted health advice.

---

## Dataset:

- **Source**: Publicly available dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Target Variable**: `NObeyesdad` â€“ Categorized obesity levels.
- **Features**:
  - Demographics: Gender, Age, Height, Weight
  - Family History
  - Dietary Habits: FAVC, FCVC, NCP, CAEC
  - Physical Activity
  - Daily Lifestyle

---

## Features:

- **Binary and Categorical Inputs**: Encoded with appropriate transformations.
- **Custom Pipelines**: Using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for scalable preprocessing.
- **Feature Selection**: Empirical analysis showed **Weight** and **Family History** as strong predictors.

---

## ML Pipeline:

- **Preprocessing**: Label encoding, scaling, null handling.
- **Models Evaluated**:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - LightGBM
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: via `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision/Recall
  - Confusion Matrix

> ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Achieve at least **90% accuracy** while reducing false positives by **10%**

---

## Results:

After experimentation:
- Achieved **~90% accuracy** on test data.
- LightGBM yielded the best balance of performance and training time.
- Family history and weight were confirmed as dominant predictors.

## Model Details:
The project uses the LightGBM (LGBM) model for prediction. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that is efficient and scalable for large datasets. The model is trained on preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
